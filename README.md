# ðŸ™ˆ Oily Monkey

Rock with injecting user script but simpler!

## Description

This extension allows users to easily inject user scripts into the target page. Users can use regular expressions to match the URL of the target page and set the script to be injected. When the extension starts running, the script will be injected every time the target page is opened.

Users can manage multiple rule configurations, but only one configuration will actually take effect in the end.
